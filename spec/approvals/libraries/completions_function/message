In order to enable completions in your script, create a command or a flag (for example: !txtgrn!download completions!txtrst! or !txtgrn!download --completions!txtrst!) that calls the !txtgrn!send_completions!txtrst! function.

Your users can then run something like this to enable completions:

  !txtpur!$ eval "$(download completions)"
