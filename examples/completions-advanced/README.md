# Advanced Runtime Completions Example

Demonstrates configured runtime completions, including static candidates,
dynamic external commands and internal functions, file and directory sources,
and the `no-space` option.

Runtime completions are enabled in `settings.yml`. Users can load the generated
Bash wrapper with:

```bash
source <(cli completions)
```

<!-- include: settings.yml src/completions_command.sh src/lib/completions.sh -->
