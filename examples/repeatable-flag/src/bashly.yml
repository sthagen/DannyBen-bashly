help: Sample application to demonstrate the use of repeatable flags
version: 0.1.0

flags:
- long: --data
  short: -d
  arg: data
  help: Provide data values
  required: true

  # Setting this to true on a flag with an argument means the user can type it
  # multiple times, like --data a --data b.
  # The argument will be received as a quoted and space-delimited string which
  # needs to be converted to an array with `eval "data=(${args[--data]})"`
  repeatable: true

- long: --verbose
  short: -v
  help: Set verbosity level

  # Setting this to true on a regular flag means the user can type it multiple
  # times, in the form of -vvv or -v -v -v.
  # The argument's value will hold the number of times it was entered.
  repeatable: true

examples:
- download -d one -d "two three" -vvv
