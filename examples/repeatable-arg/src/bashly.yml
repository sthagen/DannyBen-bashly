args:
- name: file
  help: One or more files to process

  # Setting repeatable to true means that the user can provide multiple arguments
  # for it.
  # The argument will be received as a quoted and space-delimited string which
  # needs to be converted to an array with `eval "data=(${args[file]})"`.
  repeatable: true

  # Setting unique to true will ignore non-unique repeating values.
  unique: true

  # Setting default value(s) for a repeatable argument may be done in an array
  # form (or a string form if it is a single default value only).
  default:
  - file1
  - file2
